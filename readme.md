## Introduction
explain the motivation and the business idea

## Prototype information
We have developed and tested a small-scale prototype of our grasping sorting system. Additionally, we created a digital twin to generate synthetic data for sorting and identification tests; the results were published in [(**ICRA**)](https://www.icra2024.org/) (the most prestigious robotics conference). We have analysed datasets for waste material identification and evaluated recent state-of-the-art AI models. 
Furthermore, we have studied published reports by global industry research leaders such as [**IBISWorld**](https://www.ibisworld.com/) to evaluate market size, major players, industry trends and future outlooks.
